# LHS Cyber Security Club
###The Official Website of LHS CyberSecurity Club

Cyber Security is an important part of our daily life. 
As everything is online, now days, we need to make sure that personal items stay personal.
For example, your bank account information or your precious email password needs to stay secret. 
In this club we will learn about the importance of this, and how hackers hack into our accounts. 
We will also learn to become hackers. As they say, to beat your enemy you must think like your enemy. 
In this club, you will have the mindset of a hacker. 
This mindset can not only be applied to hacking but important to life. 
We also have many practice problems and sites to use to practice your hacking and become a master. 
We will also be practicing to compete in some hacking competitions.
